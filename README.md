- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @teddyfight0
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new stuff in my free time. I really anticipate to meet amazing people on the github.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python c/c++ matlab and swift.
- ðŸ“« You can email me through cherrymark@gmail.com to communicate coding questions.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I find  it really hard to learn to code in the college because teachers don't teach at all. They only want to accomplish the task through repeat the old ppt once again!
I really wish I can learn a lot and enjoy myself on this website!!!
